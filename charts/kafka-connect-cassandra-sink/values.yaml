# errorPolicy 
# Specifies the action to be taken if an error occurs while inserting the data.
#  There are three available options:
#     NOOP - the error is swallowed
#     THROW - the error is allowed to propagate.
#     RETRY - The exception causes the Connect framework to retry the message. The number of retries is set by connect.cassandra.max.retries.
# All errors will be logged automatically, even if the code swallows them.

retryInterval: 60000

# threadpoolSize 
# The sink inserts all the data concurrently. To fail fast in case of an error, the sink has its own thread pool.
# Set the value to zero and the threadpool will default to 4* NO_OF_CPUs. Set a value greater than 0

# consistencyLevel 
# Consistency refers to how up-to-date and synchronized a row of Cassandra data is on all of its replicas.
